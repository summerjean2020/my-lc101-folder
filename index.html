        <h1>My Top 3 Vacations</h1>
        <p>While I have not travelled too much in my life, out of the
            few places I have gone, here are my top 3 vacations. 
        </p>

        <h2>1. Orange Beach, Alabama</h2>
        <p>Orange Beach Alabama was my favorite vacation due to the
            numerous activities we partook in. We spent the majority 
            of our time at the beach, but we also went parasailing and
            spent a day at a local zoo that allows you to interact 
            with the animals. Ultimately, the laid back atmosphere 
            featuring plenty of activities made for the ideal location
            for my family and I to greatly enjoy ourselves.

        <h2>2. New York</h2>
        <p>New York is a place you absolutely have to go. It was an
            amazing trip with no shortage of things to do. While this 
            is extremely good, it was also the reason this was not my
            first on the list. The abundance of activities is simply 
            overwhelming and there is no way to get to all of them. 
            While this is true, seeing the statue of liberty, spending
            time at the aquarium, and checking out Times Square are some
            of my favorite memories.

        <h2>3. Colorado</h2>
        <p>Colorado was one of the most beautiful places I have ever 
            been. I love hiking, and there are plenty of hiking trails
            and beautiful scenery to discover. In addition, my family and 
            I went zip-lining which was a wonderful experience with
            breath-taking views. While it was a great vacation, it was
            not extremely laid back, putting it at number three on my
            list.
